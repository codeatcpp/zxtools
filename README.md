# Tools to manipulate files from ZX Spectrum diskettes #

Hereâ€™s a set of utils to manipulate files that were copied from a TR-DOS diskette or from a tape.

Originally the tools were written to simplify the following workflow:
1. Grab diskette image using [Hobeta](http://speccy.info/Hobeta) tool.
2. Strip the file header and save the result to a new file.
3. Convert resulting Zeus Z80 assembler file to the plain text format.

But you can use them in the way you need. And it's very easy to use: download the package, run `setup.py`, invoke in the following way:
```
$ python -m zxtools.hobeta strip input.hobetta result.zeus
$ python -m zxtools.zeus2txt result.zeus listing.txt
```
NOTE: You need Python 3 to use this package.
